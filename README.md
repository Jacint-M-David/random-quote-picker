# Random Quote Picker Application

This application picks a random quote from the array data that is provided for it and renders the quote on the page. It also has an Auto-Play functionality, which when turned on picks a new random quote and renders it every ten seconds. For learningn purposes I solely used HTML5, CSS3 and ES6 (Vanilla JS), DOM API technologies.
